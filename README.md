FakeApiApp
This project is a simple React application designed to fetch posts from a fake API and allow users to add new posts locally. The application demonstrates the use of React components, state management, and asynchronous data fetching.

Features
Fetch Data from Fake API: The app initially fetches posts from JSONPlaceholder.
Add New Posts Locally: Users can add new posts via a form, and the posts appear at the top of the list.
Component Structure: Modular design using presentational and logical components.
